# 2D Embedding of the CIFAR-10 Dataset: Comparing Different Manifold Learning Techniques

The goal of this notebook is to explore different manifold learning techniques on the CIFAR-10 Dataset, which are approaches to dimensionality reduction and is useful for visualizing high dimensional datasets in more interpretable dimensions, like 2D. For each technique, the CIFAR-10 dataset will be projected into 2D, with the data colored by class.

This notebook will explore the following manifold learning algorithms:

* Principle Component Analysis
* Isomap Embedding
* Locally Linear Embedding
* Multidimensional scaling.
* SpectralEmbedding
* T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
